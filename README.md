### Project Title
Bikeshare Data

### Description
A simple tool to look at various bikeshare statistics from Chicago, NY, and Washington.  Includes inputs for city, month & day and 10 row data previews.  I used a number scheme throughout the project to make inputs less susceptible to error.  Included panda dataframes creation, csv file reading, if statements, and functions.  Chicago & NYC files included extra data that had to be accounted for in the inputs and output.  Note: I also made a change to the code that westernized the opening statement.

### Files used
chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv

### Credits
github, stackoverflow, udacity, python
